[This repository](https://github.com/L706077/Face-Recognition-Dataset-for-Training) provides some common datasets for training a cnn.

The blog ["Building a Facial Recognition Pipeline with Deep Learning in Tensorflow"](https://hackernoon.com/building-a-facial-recognition-pipeline-with-deep-learning-in-tensorflow-66e7645015b8) is an example tutorial to try out the tensorflow, dlib, and docker.
