In this folder, we put files for installing the Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV, and dlib based on the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Below we give a brief summary of the essential steps:

1. Download and install the Anaconda. 

After successfully installed Anaconda, navigate to [this page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows#installing_with_anaconda) then follow the instructions to install the TensorFlow on windows through the Anaconda. Be advised that, one should operate in the Anaconda Prompt instead of windows command prompt. Just find the Anaconda Prompt in the windows start menu, and give it a run. 

2. Create a conda environment named tensorflow by invoking the following command:
```
C:> conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5 
```
